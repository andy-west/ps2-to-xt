# ps2-to-xt
An Arduino-based PS/2 to PC/XT keyboard adapter

This code was originally based on pcxtkbd, but most of it has been rewritten:
https://github.com/kesrut/pcxtkbd

The program was created for and tested on a Tandy 1000 TL/2, but it should work on any system that takes an IBM PC/XT keyboard, at least in theory.

NOTE: The license is GPL v2.0 to comply with the original license. Normally I'd release it under something more permissive, like the MIT license. You can do with this code as you please, as long as you don't claim that you made it yourself. If you violate the GPL terms, I will not personally come after you. Enjoy.
